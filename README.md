### Gameplay
The player has six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. The player wins, if he/she guesses all five letters correctly. If the player does not guess all five letters within the six tries, he/she loses the game and has no more options to guess the word. In this case the word be revealed, but the player does not get any points. 

### How to play
To play the game simply type on your `keyboard` or use the keyboard displayed in the browser to enter a letter.
You can type up to 5 letters and sumbit your answer by pressing `enter` on your keyboard.
After every guess, each letter is marked as either green, yellow or gray: 
- green indicates that letter is correct and in the correct position
- yellow means it is in the answer but not in the right position
- gray indicates it is not in the answer at all.

#### Bonus information about the game & the creator's story
Excerpt from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Wardle#Wordle):

In 2013, while working at Reddit, Josh Wardle made a prototype of word game Wordle, a play on his last name.

In January 2021, he returned to his 2013 prototype to create a word game for his partner, Palak Shah. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he and Shah had played many New York Times games including Spelling Bee, and he wanted to make a new word game that they could play together. Shah played a vital role in the game's development before it went public. She reviewed the English language's 12,000 five-letter words and narrowed them down to 2,500 commonly-known words that could be used in the daily puzzle.

At first, only Wardle's family played Wordle, until Wardle made it widely available in October 2021 by posting it on his own website, powerlanguage.co.uk. Wordle had no advertisements and Wardle's goal was not to make money. Despite Wordle's success, Wardle did not want it to become his full-time job.

The game had 90 players by 1 November, within a month of Wardle making it public. Three months later the game had 300,000 daily players, which rose to two million by the following week.

In January 2022, The New York Times Company announced that it had acquired Wordle "for an undisclosed price in the low-seven figures".
